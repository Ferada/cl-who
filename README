Because I won't edit that raw HTML, what follows is the description of
some additions in this fork of CL-WHO.

* XML namespaces

Basically, you can now use the syntax (:PREFIX . TAG) in every position
normally only a keyword would work.  The prefix has to be a keyword so
using a macro in that position will still work; the tag has no
restriction, it's not evaluated, so the following examples will work.

    (with-html-output (*standard-output* NIL)
      ((:xsl . stylesheet) :version 1.0
        ((:xsl . template) :match "@*|node()"
          ((:xsl . copy)
            ((:xsl . apply-templates) :select "@*|node()")))))

    (with-html-output (*standard-output* NIL)
      ((:p :class "foo") "Paragraph")
      (((:html . p) (:html . class) "foo") "Paragraph"))

The next two examples will throw an error, but the point is that the
macro ESC is still called instead of being converted to the tag
"esc:foo" or the sequence "esc:foo='blub'".

    (with-html-output (*standard-output* NIL)
      ((esc . "foo") "Paragraph"))

    (with-html-output (*standard-output* NIL)
      ((:p (esc . "foo") "blub") "Paragraph"))
